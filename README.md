# Exploratory Projects 

In this github repo, I aim to create a AI/ML project every week.

This week I'm creating a project to classify the Hotel reservation based on hotel bookings. 

## Setting up project

### Downloading Kaggle dataset
1. pip install `requirements.txt`
2. You need to create your kaggle account and download your credential `kaggle.json` file
3. run bash file (kaggle datasets download -d ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset, unzip into dataset folder)
